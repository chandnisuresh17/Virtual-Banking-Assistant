IBM GRM project.
Topic:How AI can solve some of the problems posted by COVID.



The COVID-19 pandemic has left its impact on every industry, especially on the global economy and financial sector. Bank helplines are receiving a lot of calls with general queries regarding loans, mortgages, bank charges, etc. which keeps the helpline and helpline agents occupied. Therefore, to reduce the workload and save time for customers and helpline agents we have created a COVID-19 Virtual Banking Assistant using technologies such as Watson Assistant for leveraging the chatbot and IBM
Cloud for connecting Web Application UI to Watson Assistant.
